# Sobered

Sobered is an application designed to help people in recovery find groups online nearby for support, especially during these trying times of separation. 
Users are able to create an account and either choose to join or create a new meetup group and see things such as meeting days and times, a description
of the group, a zoom link if there is a recurring meetup link, and more! In times of more direct need, users can participate in a real time chat
built into their main dashboard at any time. This chat only shows messages sent upon their last login so as to keep the conversation focused on immediate support needs.

This application was created using React, SASS, and Express in April 2020. Visit Sobered at Sobered.life to see it in action.
